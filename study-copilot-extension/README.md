# Study Copilot Chrome Extension

## Project Description

Develop a Chrome extension using React that functions as a study copilot for users. Include a small image in the bottom right corner that, when clicked, opens a chat popup for text input and output powered by GPT-4. Allow users to interact with the chat to ask questions, set study goals, or receive study tips during their sessions.

Implement a Pomodoro timer feature where users can start a study session and specify what they want to study. Ensure that during the Pomodoro session, the extension monitors the tabs the user visits and prompts warnings if they navigate to irrelevant websites.

## Enhancements and Improvements

Incorporate a feature that tracks the user's progress during study sessions and provides feedback or suggestions for improvement. Allow users to customize study targets and receive personalized recommendations based on their study habits and goals. Integrate with popular study tools or platforms to enhance the user's study experience and productivity. Enable users to set reminders or notifications for study sessions, breaks, or upcoming deadlines to help them stay organized and focused.

## Programming Languages

- React for building the Chrome extension due to its component-based architecture and ease of use for creating interactive UI elements.

## APIs

- GPT-4 API for powering the chat functionality, allowing users to interact with the study copilot through natural language input and receive intelligent responses.

## Packages and Libraries

- Reactstrap (latest version) for styling components and ensuring a responsive design for the Chrome extension.
- Axios (latest version) for handling HTTP requests to interact with the GPT-4 API seamlessly.
- Moment.js (latest version) for managing time-related functionalities such as the Pomodoro timer and study session tracking.

## Rationale for Technical Choices

React was chosen for its flexibility in creating dynamic user interfaces and its ability to efficiently handle state management in a Chrome extension. GPT-4 API was selected to provide users with an advanced chat experience powered by AI, enhancing the study copilot's capabilities. Reactstrap was chosen to streamline the styling process and ensure a visually appealing design that adapts to different screen sizes. Axios was selected for its simplicity in making API calls and handling responses, making it ideal for integrating with the GPT-4 API. Moment.js was chosen for its robust time manipulation capabilities, essential for implementing features like the Pomodoro timer and session tracking.

This setup will enable the development of a feature-rich study copilot Chrome extension that enhances users' study experience through interactive chat, study session monitoring, personalized recommendations, and integration with study tools, all while keeping users organized with reminders and notifications.
